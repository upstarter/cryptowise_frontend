      description: `DFINITY, a global internet computer that aims to reinvent the internet as a
        computer that runs secure software with superpowers, is developing the ICP protocol (Internet Computer Protocol) that makes
        it possible for independent data centers to combine the capacity of millions of
        standardized computers to add native, universal, secure and seamless serverless
        cloud functionality to the Internet - in much the same way TCP/IP protocols
        combine private networks to provide the public Internet connectivity we rely on
        today. Adding cloud functionality
        to the Internet using a secure crypto-based protocol provides a tamperproof
        environment where hackproof and unstoppable software can be created. The
        objective of the DFINITY project is to enable the Internet to natively host the
        world's next generation of software systems, mass market Internet services, and
        data`,
